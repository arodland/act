<h3>Why Sponsor YAPC?</h3>
<p>Perl is an Open Source and Open Community programming language, and among the top ten in the world. YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference) is the group of premier annual Perl-specific conferences. </p>

<p>YAPC::NA has been a regularly attended annual conference since 1999, with delegates and speakers from around North America, UK, Europe and the world. Although the primary subject for tutorials and presentations is the Perl programming language, many Open Source projects, such as Parrot, Apache, MySQL and Linux, have been covered as well.</p>

<p>When a company sponsors YAPC they are really supporting the Perl language and the Perl community. The stronger the community becomes the more robust and the better the language becomes.</p>

<p>The YAPC conference is run on minimal cost basis so that a couple of objectives can be met:</p>

<p>Educating the masses. Each year about a quarter of all attendees pay their own way to YAPC. Keeping registration fees reasonable means that we can maximize the number of people who can attend.</p>

<p>YAPC gives back. The initial goal of the YAPC conference is to cover all of its costs; once all costs are resolved the remaining funds are given back to the community through grants. Funding YAPC equates to funding the future development of Perl.
Every donation makes a difference to the community. Sponsorship starts as little as $200.00 at the bronze level and goes all the way up to helping carry the conference for $10,000 at the platinum level.</p>

<p>Please take a moment and consider what your company can do to help the Perl Community through a donation to the YAPC conference.</p>

<h3>Brand and Product Awareness</h3>
<p>The conference is attended by IT professionals — the majority of whom are from around North America, UK and Europe, with a small number from further overseas. Most of the attendees are Developers, System Administrators and Technical Architects, although there is also a significant proportion of CIO’s and CEOs. The impact of the conference can be felt far wider than the number of attendees – many open source websites, will feature references to YAPC::NA and attract high traffic, which will provide exposure for key sponsors.</p>

<h3>Recruitment Opportunity</h3>
<p>Historically YAPC::NA has attracted much of North America’s leading Perl talent, and the format of this conference will provide sponsors with a fantastic opportunity to have representatives on site to meet and discuss issues and opportunities with delegates.</p>

<h3>Promote Your Open Source Credentials</h3>
<p>What better way to promote your organization’s commitment to leverage the benefits of Open Source technologies, than to sponsor an event such as the North American Perl Conference? By demonstrating a symbiotic relationship with the grass roots of a large Open Source movement such as the North American Perl Community, you can demonstrate a level of understanding and commitment to Open Source that will distinguish yourself from your competitors.</p>

<h3>Tax Deductible Contributions</h3>
<p>The YAPC Conference is a part of the Perl Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Holland, Michigan. Contributions made to the YAPC Conference may be tax deductible. More information on the tax status of The Perl Foundation can be found at <a href="http://donate.perlfoundation.org/">https://secure.donor.com/pf012/give</a>.</p>
