<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
<p>The Perl Foundation is an organization created to cultivate an
open-source ecosystem around the Perl programming language. It does
this through a series of programs that are funded primarily through
sponsorships and donations.</p>

<p>The oldest program established by the Perl Foundation is the Yet
Another Perl Conference (YAPC), which has become a group of global
workshops and conferences focusing on Perl. The original North
American conference is now known as YAPC::NA.</p>

<h3>YAPC::NA</h3>

<p>Perl is an Open Source and Open Community programming language,
and among the most popular languages in the world. YAPC (Yet
Another Perl Conference) is the group of premier annual
Perl-specific conferences, YAPC::NA is the North American
conference. This year YAPC::NA (North America) will be held at the
DoubleTree Orlando Downtown Orlando, June 23rd &mdash;
25th, 2014.</p>

<p>YAPC::NA has been a regularly attended annual conference since
1999, with delegates and speakers from around North America, UK,
Europe, Asia and the world. Although the primary subject for
tutorials and presentations is the Perl language and community,
many Open Source projects, git, Apache, MySQL and Linux, have been
covered as well.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Sponsorship</h3>

<p>Sponsors of the Perl Foundation receieve several benefits,
increased brand awareness, recruitment opportunities at workshops
and conferences, promotion of their support for Open Source, and a
continually improving open-source programming language for their
business. These benefits may be tied directly to the events at
YAPC::NA or they may be played out through multiple Perl Foundation
programs depending on your level of sponsorship.</p>

<p>Details on sponsorship and how the Perl Foundation uses money it
raises can be found in the <a href=

Sponsorship Prospectus</a>. Below are some points when considering
sponsoring the Perl Foundation in the context of YAPC::NA.</p>

<h3>Brand and Product Awareness</h3>

<p>The conference is attended by IT professionals &mdash; the
majority of whom are from around North America, UK and Europe, with
a small number from further overseas. Most of the attendees are
Developers, System Administrators and Technical Architects,
although there is also a significant proportion of
CIO&#39;s and CEOs. The impact of the conference can
be felt far wider than the number of attendees &mdash;
many open source websites will feature references to YAPC::NA and
attract high traffic, which will provide exposure for key
sponsors.</p>

<h3>Recruitment Opportunity</h3>

<p>Historically YAPC::NA has attracted much of North
America&#39;s leading Perl talent, and the format of
this conference will provide sponsors with a fantastic opportunity
to have representatives on site to meet and discuss issues and
opportunities with delegates.</p>

<h3>Promote your Open Source Credentials</h3>

<p>What better way to promote your organization&#39;s commitment
to leverage the benefits of Open Source technologies, than to
sponsor an event such as the North American Perl Conference through
a donation to The Perl Foundation? By demonstrating a symbiotic
relationship with the grass roots of a large Open Source movement
such as the Perl Community, you can demonstrate a level of
understanding and commitment to Open Source that will distinguish
yourself from your competitors.</p>

<h3>Tax Deductible Contributions</h3>

originally incorporated as &ldquo;Yet Another Society&rdquo;, so
that&#39;s the name you&#39;ll see in the earlier documents.

does a better job of explaining what we do. The Perl Foundation is
