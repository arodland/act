<h2>Why Sponsor YAPC::NA?</h2>

<p class="sweet-justice">Perl is an Open Source and Open Community programming language, and
among the <a
href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">top
ten</a> in the world. YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference) is the group of
premier annual Perl-specific conferences. This year YAPC::NA (North
America) will be held at the <a href="[% make_uri_info('venue.html') %]">Crowne Plaza
Asheville, June 27st &ndash; 29th, 2010.</a></p>

<p class="sweet-justice">YAPC::NA has been a regularly attended annual conference since 1999,
with delegates and speakers from around North America, UK, Europe and
the world. Although the primary subject for tutorials and presentations
is the Perl programming language, many Open Source projects, such as
Parrot, Apache, MySQL and Linux, have been covered as well.</p>

<p class="sweet-justice">When a company sponsors YAPC they are really supporting the Perl
language and the Perl community. The stronger the community becomes the
more robust and the better the language becomes.</p>

<p class="sweet-justice">The YAPC conference is run on minimal cost basis so that a couple of
objectives can be met:</p>

<ol>
    <li> Educating the masses. Each year about a quarter of all
    attendees pay their own way to YAPC. Keeping registration fees
    reasonable means that we can maximize the number of people who can
    attend.</li>
    
    <li> YAPC gives back. The initial goal of the YAPC conference is to
    cover all of its costs; once all costs are resolved the remaining
    funds are given back to the community through grants. Funding YAPC
    equates to funding the future development of Perl.</li>
</ol>

<p class="sweet-justice">Every donation makes a difference to the community. Sponsorship
starts as little as $200.00 at the bronze level and goes all the way up
to helping carry the conference for $10,000 at the platinum level.</p>

<p class="sweet-justice">Please take a moment and consider what your company can do to help
the Perl Community through a donation to the YAPC conference. For more
information please contact us at <a
href="mailto:sponsors@yapc2011.us">sponsors@yapc2011.us</a>.</p>

<h3>Brand and Product Awareness</h3>

<p class="sweet-justice">The conference is attended by IT professionals &mdash; the majority
of whom are from around North America, UK and Europe, with a small
number from further overseas. Most of the attendees are Developers,
System Administrators and Technical Architects, although there is also a
significant proportion of CIO’s and CEOs. The impact of the conference
can be felt far wider than the number of attendees – many open source
websites, will feature references to YAPC::NA and attract high traffic,
which will provide exposure for key sponsors.</p>

<h3>Recruitment Opportunity</h3>

<p class="sweet-justice">Historically YAPC::NA has attracted much of North America’s leading
Perl talent, and the format of this conference will provide sponsors
with a fantastic opportunity to have representatives on site to meet and
discuss issues and opportunities with delegates.</p>

<h3>Promote your Open Source Credentials</h3>

<p class="sweet-justice">What better way to promote your organization&rsquo;s commitment to leverage
the benefits of Open Source technologies, than to sponsor an event such
as the North American Perl Conference? By demonstrating a symbiotic
relationship with the grass roots of a large Open Source movement such
as the North American Perl Community, you can demonstrate a level of
understanding and commitment to Open Source that will distinguish
yourself from your competitors.</p>

<h3>Tax Deductible Contributions</h3>

<p class="sweet-justice">The YAPC Conference is a part of the Perl Foundation, a non-profit
501(c)(3) organization based in Holland, Michigan. Contributions made to
the YAPC Conference may be tax deductible. More information on the tax
status of The Perl Foundation can be found at <a

what we do. The Perl Foundation is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization
