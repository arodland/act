<h3>Job Fair - Tuesday June 4th - Thompson Conference Center room 2.120 - 11:00-3:30</h3>
<p>We're holding a job fair at YAPC::NA 2013. If you're looking for a job, this is the best place to pre-interview potential employers.</p>
<p>It's recommended to bring printed resumes because those that do have them have an advantage of immediate information availability; otherwise you're at a disadvantage.</p>
