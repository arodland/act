<p class="sweet-justice">The Venue for YAPC &ndash; NA 2011 is the <a
href="http://www.ashevillecp.com/">Asheville Crowne Plaza Resort</a>.
    <blockquote>Thoughtfully designed to respect and celebrate our
    unique natural environment, the resort greets visitors with towering
    stone walls, rich hardwood accents, sumptuous furnishings and,
    during the cool season, the comforting warmth of a grand stone
    fireplace.</blockquote>
