<h2>Birds of a Feather Sessions</h2>

<p>Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions provide face to face exposure to
those interested in the same projects and concepts. BoFs can be
organized for individual projects or broader topics (best practices,
open data, standards). BoFs are entirely up to you. We post your topic
online and onsite and provide the space and time. You provide the
engaging topic.</p>

<p>Space and a notice on the official schedule will be allocated during
the conference for people who would like to hold BoF sessions. Spaces
will be allocated in a first-come first-serve manner. Please contact an
organizer to schedule your BoF.</p>
