<h3>Job Fair</h3>
<p>
We're holding a job fair at YAPC::NA 2013.
If you're an organization looking to hire developers, this is your best chance to find a whole bunch of great developers in one place.
If you're looking for a job, this is the best place to pre-interview potential employers.
</p>


<h3>What Happens At The Job Fair?</h3>
<p>
At the YAPC::NA Job Fair we (the conference organizers) will work hard to funnel as many qualified Perl developers to the booths of desirable Perl employers as possible.
Employers will set up and run booths.
These booths and the people running them will tell prospective candidates about the company, and what kinds of positions they have open now or will be hiring in the future.
</p>

<p>
Many employers will accept resumes and schedule interviews right on site.

<h3>Why Sponsor YAPC Job Fair?</h3>

Having a table at the Job Fair is a great way for you to meet highly qualified candidates for the positions you have open, and for you to make connections for positions you'll have open in the future.

<p>
It's hard to beat the publicity we'll bring about your open positions between now and the conference.
Once you sign up for the Job Fair, we'll promote your Perl-related positions on our blog, Facebook, RSS, and Twitter feeds.
That means you'll be reaching the thousand plus Perl programmers that subscribe to our news feeds.
In addition, the Job Fair will be highly publicized, and open, not only to attendees, but all persons interested that want to come meet with you.
That means we'll draw a crowd of Perl people in Austin and beyond that are interested in a new position.
