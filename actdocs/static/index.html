<p>Come to <strong>Austin, Texas June 3-5</strong> for a great conference.  You'll be part of Perl's 25th birthday celebration.

<p>The conference will be held in the Joe C. Thompson Conference Center on the campus of the University of Texas.  The city of Austin offers a great variety of entertainment and diversion, especially for music lovers.</p>
